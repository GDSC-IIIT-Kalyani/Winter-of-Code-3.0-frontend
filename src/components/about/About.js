        GDSC IIIT Kalyani brings to you, yet again, our open source program
        Winter of Code 3.0 with collaborative efforts from 10+ Google Developer
        Student Clubs. The program will last for a period of two months and will
        be based on the lines of GSoC. Student applicants will be required to
        send proposals to organisations to work on their open-source projects
        while their mentors evaluate them over a course of 2 months.
